## Note
I'm just a fan of Cracking the Crypt who noticed comments about the poor color accessibility of the web app so I figured I'd take a crack at helping to fill a need. I have little-to-no experience designing for accsibiliity; I just grabbed the "Wong" palette from [this webpage](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23000000-%23E69F00-%2356B4E9-%23009E73-%23F0E442-%230072B2-%23D55E00-%23CC79A7) which was from [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618) by Bang Wong. I'm totally open to requests/input/suggestions.
